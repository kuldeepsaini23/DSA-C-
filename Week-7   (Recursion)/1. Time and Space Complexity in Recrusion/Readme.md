# Time Complecity and Space Complexity
### Binary Search
**n is number of iterations**
- Time Complecity: O(logn)
- Space Complexity: O(logn)

### Factorial
**n is number of spaces adn m is spces taken in 1 iteration**
- Time Complecity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n*m)

### Fibonacci
**n is input**
- 1-D Dp is used to solve fibonacci in O(n) time complexity
- Time Complecity: O(2^n) --> Worst Time complexity
- Space Complexity: O(n)

### Print Array
**n is number of Iterations**
- Time Complecity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
